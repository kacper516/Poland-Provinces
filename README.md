# Poland-Provinces
This is a simple game in which we can test our knowledge about provinces in Poland. I left Polish names on purpose, but they do not contain Polish characters at all so everyone can try this game by yourself.
</br>When we think that we guessed every province we know, we can stop guessing by write a simple message "stop" as answer. After that this programm will generate a csv file with provinces you didn't guess.
</br></br>When you guess every province game will end imidiately and show you full filed map with congratulations.
